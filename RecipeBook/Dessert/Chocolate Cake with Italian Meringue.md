## Instructions

### For the Cake
1. **Prepare Chocolate Mixture:** Bring milk to a boil in a large saucepan, remove from heat, whisk in cocoa powder, and let it cool slightly. Meanwhile, chop the chocolate bar into small pieces.
2. **Make Batter:** Add sugar and molasses (or brown sugar), oil, sour cream, and vanilla to the saucepan. Crack in the eggs and whisk to combine. Whisk in flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
3. **Bake Cake:** Pour batter into two greased 9 or 10-inch cake pans lined with parchment rounds. Bake at 350°F until a toothpick comes out clean or the internal temperature reaches 205-210°F, about 40 minutes. Cool thoroughly before removing from pans.

### For the Frosting
1. **Prepare Meringue:** Beat egg whites with cornstarch and cream of tartar until soft peaks form.
2. **Make Syrup:** In a saucepan, combine water, sugar, and corn syrup. Bring to a boil until it reaches 240-245°F.
3. **Combine:** Drizzle hot syrup into egg whites while beating. Continue beating until the meringue stops increasing in volume, about 3-4 minutes. Beat in vanilla.
4. **Frost Cake:** Let meringue cool slightly before frosting the cake. Optionally, top with sprinkles.
