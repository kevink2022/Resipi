## Ingredients
- **Eggs** - 6
- **Oil** - 75g
- **Chocolate Chips** - 35g (plus more for the top)
- **Milk** - 60g
- **Dutch Cocoa Powder** - 40g
- **Flour** - 75g
- **Sugar** - 130g
- **Vanilla Extract**
- **Salt**
- **Cream of Tartar**

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Oven and Pans:** Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Place a larger pan that can contain the cake pan on the middle rack of the oven, and fill it part-way with water. Line an 8-inch square cake pan with parchment paper on both bottom and sides.
2. **Make Chocolate Mixture:** Combine oil, chocolate chips, and milk in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until just boiling. Add cocoa powder, flour, and a splash of vanilla, then whisk until smooth.
3. **Combine with Eggs:** Crack eggs into a separate bowl, separating the yolks. Whisk yolks into the chocolate mixture.
4. **Make Meringue:** Add a tiny pinch of salt and cream of tartar to the egg whites. Beat until fluffy and stiff. Gradually beat in sugar in three parts to form a stiff, glossy meringue.
5. **Fold Meringue:** Fold a quarter of the meringue into the chocolate mixture until smooth. Then gently fold this mixture into the remaining meringue until homogeneous, stirring as little as possible.
6. **Bake:** Pour batter into the prepared cake pan. Scatter additional chocolate chips on top. Place the pan in the water bath in the oven. Bake until a skewer comes out almost clean, about an hour.

Enjoy your delicious 8-Inch Square Cake!
