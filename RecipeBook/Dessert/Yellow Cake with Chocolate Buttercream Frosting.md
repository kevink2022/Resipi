## Ingredients

### For the Cakes
- **Butter, Softened** - 1.5 sticks (3/4 cup, 170g)
- **Granulated Sugar** - 1.5 cups (300g)
- **Whole Eggs** - 2
- **Egg Yolks** - 2
- **Buttermilk** - 1.5 cups (350mL) (can use sour cream or crème fraîche)
- **Vanilla Extract** - 2-3 teaspoons
- **Cake Flour** - 2.5 cups (300g) (or 7 parts AP flour + 1 part starch)
- **Baking Soda** - 1/2 teaspoon
- **Baking Powder** - 2 teaspoons
- **Salt** - 2-3g (1/2 teaspoon of Morton kosher; double if using unsalted butter)

### For the Frosting
- **Butter, Softened** - 2 sticks (1 cup, 225g)
- **Cocoa Powder** - 1/2-1 cup (50-100g)
- **Powdered Sugar** - 2.5 cups (300g)
- **Corn Syrup** - 1/2 cup (120mL)
- **Meringue Powder** - 1 heaped tablespoon (optional)
- **Vanilla Extract** 
- **Milk/Buttermilk/Water** (as needed for consistency)
- **Sprinkles** (optional)

## Instructions

### For the Cake
1. **Prepare Pans:** Grease two 8-inch cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment rounds.
2. **Make Batter:** Whip the softened butter until fluffy. Add sugar and continue to whip. Gradually beat in eggs, yolks, buttermilk, and vanilla. Beat in dry ingredients to achieve a pudding-like batter texture.
3. **Bake:** Divide batter evenly between the pans. Bake at 350°F (180°C) until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool before removing from pans.
4. **Cool Cakes:** Invert cakes out of pans, remove parchment, and cool to room temperature.

### For the Frosting
1. **Whip Butter:** Whip the butter until fluffy. Beat in powdered sugar, then cocoa powder.
2. **Add Remaining Ingredients:** Beat in corn syrup and meringue powder. Add vanilla, salt (if needed), and a little liquid to achieve spreadable consistency.
3. **Frost Cake:** Trim cake tops flat. Place one cake on a serving plate, top with frosting, then add the second cake and frost. Spread icing around the sides and add sprinkles if desired.
4. **Serve:** Clean the plate rim and refrigerate the cake for a firmer texture if preferred.
