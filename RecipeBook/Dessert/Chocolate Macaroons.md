## Ingredients

- **Egg Whites** - 2
- **Granulated Sugar** - 1/2 cup (100g)ÍÍ
- **Almond Flour** - 3/4 cup (70g)
- **Powdered Sugar** - 3/4 cup (90g)
- **Cocoa Powder** - 1/4 cup (30g)
- **Salt** - A few grains
- **Cream** - For ganache (small quantity)
- **Chocolate** - For ganache (equal quantity to cream by volume)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Meringue:** Beat egg whites until fluffy. Add granulated sugar and continue beating until glossy with floppy peaks. Fold in almond flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and a few grains of salt until achieving a mousse-like consistency.
2. **Bake Meringues:** Cover a sheet pan with parchment paper. Spoon batter into 20 dollops. Let them sit and dry for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Bake until meringues start to crack, about 15 minutes. Cool completely before filling.
3. **Make Ganache:** Combine a small amount of cream with an equal volume of chocolate. Microwave until just bubbling, let sit for a minute, then stir until smooth. Cool to a spreadable consistency.
4. **Assemble Cookies:** Once meringues are cool, spread ganache between two cookies to make sandwiches.
