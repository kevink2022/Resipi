## Ingredients

### For the Cake
- **Cake Flour** - 1/2 cup (60g) (all-purpose is also fine)
- **Powdered Sugar** - 1 1/4 cups (150g) (or 3/4 cup granulated sugar)
- **Cocoa Powder** - 1/2 cup (50g) (replace with more flour for non-chocolate version)
- **Baking Powder** - 1 teaspoon
- **Salt** - 1/4 teaspoon
- **Egg Yolks** - 4 (reserve the whites for the meringue)
- **Greek Yogurt** - 1/2 cup (140g) (sour cream can be used instead)
- **Milk** - 1/3 cup (85 mL) (coffee or water is also fine)
- **Neutrally-Flavored Cooking Oil** - 1/2 cup (120 mL)

### For the Ice Cream
- **Ice Cream** - Two pints (946 mL) (any flavor, strawberry was used here)

### For the Meringue
- **Egg Whites** - 4 (reserved from the yolks for the cake)
- **Cream of Tartar** - 1/2 teaspoon (lemon or vinegar can be used instead)
- **Cornstarch** - 1/2 teaspoon
- **Sugar** - 1 cup (200g)
- **Water** - 1/2 cup (120 mL)
- **Corn Syrup** - A squeeze (honey can be used instead)
- **Vanilla Extract** - 1 teaspoon
- **Salt** - Tiny pinch

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Cake Pan:** Use a 9-inch square cake pan. Cut a square of parchment paper to fit and slit the corners to sit securely in the pan.
2. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC).
3. **Make Cake Batter:** Combine all cake ingredients and whisk until smooth. Pour into the prepared pan and bake until a skewer comes out clean (about 25 minutes).
4. **Cool and Freeze Cake:** Let the cake cool, then freeze for at least 30 minutes.
5. **Soften Ice Cream:** Let ice cream soften on the counter for about 10 minutes.
6. **Add Ice Cream Layer:** Spread softened ice cream evenly over the frozen cake. Return to freezer.
7. **Make Meringue:** In a saucepan, combine sugar, water, and corn syrup and bring to a boil. Whip egg whites with cream of tartar and cornstarch to firm peaks. Carefully drizzle boiling syrup into egg whites while whipping. Continue until meringue cools to warm. Mix in vanilla and salt.
8. **Add Meringue Layer:** Spread meringue over ice cream layer and return to freezer for a few hours or overnight.
9. **Serve:** Lift dessert out using parchment paper. Peel off the paper and cut into slices. Brown the top using one of four methods: broiler, fire stick, kitchen torch, or ignited high-proof spirit.
