(Makes about 10)
## Ingredients

- **White Lilly Self-Rising Flour** - 2 1/2 cups (or 2 1/2 cups cake flour, 3 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt), plus more for dusting
- **Sugar** - 1-2 teaspoons
- **Salted Butter** - 1 stick (frozen solid; use unsalted butter plus 1/4 teaspoon salt if needed)
- **Buttermilk, Cold** - 1 cup
- **Melted Butter** - For brushing the tops

## Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat oven to 475Â°F.
2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a mixing bowl, measure out the flour and sugar.
3. **Grate Butter:** Grate the frozen butter using the big holes on a box grater. Toss the butter with the flour mixture and place the bowl in the freezer for 15 minutes.
4. **Combine with Buttermilk:** Gently mix in the buttermilk, then turn the mixture onto a well-floured surface.
5. **Fold and Roll Dough:** Mold into a lump, flour the surface, and roll out to one inch thick. Fold it over itself and roll out again. Repeat for a total of four folds, rolling out to an inch thickness each time.
6. **Cut Biscuits:** Use a sharp circular cutter (or a knife) to punch out biscuits. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
7. **Bake:** Brush the biscuits with melted butter. Bake until puffy and golden, about 15 minutes.
