## Ingredients
- **Water** - 1/2 cup
- **Yeast** - A pinch (no more than 1/8 teaspoon)
- **Salt** - 1/2 teaspoon
- **Bread Flour** - 1 cup (use more if substituting with all-purpose flour)

*Note: This recipe requires a food-grade spray bottle filled with water.

## Instructions

1. **Mix Dough:** In a small glass container (at least twice the volume of your dough, approximately 1 quart), mix the water, yeast, salt, and flour until just combined. The dough should be wet enough to have no dry patches. Adjust with more water or flour if necessary.
2. **First Rise:** Cover and allow to rise on the counter for a few hours until about doubled in size, then refrigerate overnight. Alternatively, put it straight into the refrigerator for a week.
3. **Shape and Second Rise:** Prepare a parchment-lined baking sheet. With wet hands, stretch the cold dough into a snake the length of the pan diagonally. Lay the dough on the parchment diagonally, allowing it to stick. Spray the top with water to prevent drying out. Let it rise for about an hour until puffy.
4. **Bake:** Bake at 500Â°F, spraying the bread frequently with water, especially during the first 10 minutes until fully puffed up. Bake until the crust is dark amber and the bread is done, about 20-25 minutes.
