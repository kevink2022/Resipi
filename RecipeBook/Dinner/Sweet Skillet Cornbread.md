## Ingredients

### For the Batter
- **Egg** - 1
- **Vegetable Oil** - 1/3 cup
- **Milk** - 1 cup
- **Sugar** - 3/4 cup
- **Salt** - 3/4 teaspoon
- **Baking Powder** - 1 heaped tablespoon
- **Flour** - 1 cup
- **Cornmeal** - 1 cup

### For the Pan
- **Unsalted Butter** - 1 tablespoon

## Directions

1. **Preheat Pan and Oven:** Place a 10-inch nonstick skillet or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet in the oven and preheat to 400Â°F.
2. **Mix Batter:** Whisk together the egg, vegetable oil, milk, and sugar until smooth. Whisk in the flour and cornmeal just until smooth, being careful not to over-mix.
3. **Prepare Pan:** When the oven and pan are hot, carefully remove the pan and add the butter, swirling to melt. Use a paper towel to spread the butter around the edges and absorb any excess.
4. **Bake Cornbread:** Pour the batter into the hot pan. Return to the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Avoid over-baking.
5. **Cool:** Let the cornbread rest in the pan for 5 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool.

Enjoy your homemade Cornbread!
