## Ingredients

- **Dried Elbow Pasta** - 1/4 lb (113 g)
- **Milk** - 1/3-1/2 cup (80-120 ml)
- **Butter** - 1-2 tablespoons (15-30 g)
- **Semi-Firm Cheese(s), Grated** - 1 cup (100 g)
- **Sodium Citrate** - 1 teaspoon (4 g) (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Cheese:** Grate your choice of cheese(s). A combination of smoked gouda and sharp cheddar is recommended.
2. **Boil the Pasta:** Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the elbow pasta according to package instructions.
3. **Make the Cheese Sauce:** In a separate cold pot, combine milk (start with the smaller amount), grated cheese, sodium citrate (if using), and butter. Heat over medium-high, stirring constantly, until the mixture is fully melted and simmering. If the sauce appears too thick, add more milk, keeping in mind it will thicken as it cools.
4. **Combine Pasta and Sauce:** Once the noodles are cooked, drain them and stir into the cheese sauce.
5. **Season to Taste:** Add additional seasonings as desired, such as garlic and mustard powder.

Enjoy your creamy and delicious Macaroni and Cheese!
