## Ingredients
- **Potatoes** (amount varies; one large Russet potato per person recommended)
- **Oil** (enough to coat)
- **Seasonings** (coarse salt, pepper, garlic powder, chopped cilantro, grated Parmesan, or others as preferred)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Potatoes:** Choose your preferred type of potatoes. Peel them (optional) and cut into fry-like shapes. Aim for roughly equal thickness and about twice the thickness you desire in the final product, as they'll shrink during cooking.
2. **Boil Potatoes:** Boil the cut potatoes until they're very soft, about 8 minutes, but be careful not to let them fall apart. 
3. **Drain and Oil:** Gently drain the boiled potatoes. Lay them on a pan in a single layer. Drizzle with enough oil to thoroughly coat all the pieces. Shake the pan to evenly distribute the oil and fries.
4. **Roast:** Roast in an oven preheated to 450ÂºF. After 45 minutes, check the fries. Add more oil if they look dry and rearrange any unevenly cooking pieces. Continue roasting until they are brown and crispy, potentially another 45 minutes. Avoid overcooking.
5. **Cool and Absorb Oil:** Place kitchen towel or paper towels in a large bowl. Transfer the fries to the bowl to let the towel absorb excess oil. Remove the towel.
6. **Season and Serve:** Season the fries directly in the bowl. Suggested seasonings include coarse salt, pepper, garlic powder, chopped cilantro, and grated Parmesan. Toss to evenly coat and serve.
