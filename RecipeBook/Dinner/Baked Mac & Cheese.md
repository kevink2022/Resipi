## Ingredients
- **Dried Pasta Shells** - 1 lb
- **Milk** - 3 cups
- **White Wine** - 1 cup
- **Sharp Cheddar Cheese** - 1/2 lb
- **Smoked Gouda Cheese** - 1/2 lb
- **Butter** - 1/2 stick

- **Mustard Powder** - 1/2 teaspoon
- **Garlic Powder** - 1/2 teaspoon

## Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven and Boil Pasta:** Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Start boiling water for the pasta. Grate the cheese.
2. **Prepare Cheese Sauce:** In another pot, warm milk and wine over medium heat. Add sodium citrate, mustard powder, garlic powder, black pepper, and a pinch of cayenne. Add butter. Gradually whisk in handfuls of grated cheese until fully melted, then turn off the heat.
3. **Cook Pasta:** Salt the boiling water and parboil the pasta shells for five minutes.
4. **Assemble:** Oil or spray a 2.5-quart baking dish. Pour in the drained pasta and the cheese sauce. Stir to combine.
5. **Bake:** Cover the dish and bake for 45 minutes. Then, uncover and bake for an additional 30 minutes until brown on top. For extra browning, turn on the broiler at the end.
6. **Rest Before Serving:** Let the dish rest for 30 minutes before scooping it out.
