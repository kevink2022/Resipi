## Instructions

1. **Marinate the Chicken:** Cut and pound the chicken breasts to even thickness. Season with salt, pepper, and some chopped garlic. Marinate in white wine and refrigerate.
2. **Prepare the Tomato Sauce:** Fry shallots and remaining garlic in olive oil until soft. Add tomato paste, fry briefly, then add crushed tomatoes and a glug of white wine. Simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring frequently.
3. **Bread the Chicken:** Set up flour, beaten egg, and a mixture of Panko breadcrumbs and grated cheese on separate plates. Dry the chicken, then coat each piece in flour, egg, and breadcrumb/cheese mix.
4. **Cook the Chicken:** In a wide pan with a heavy coating of olive oil, fry the chicken over medium heat until golden and cooked through (internal temperature of 160 F), about 6-8 minutes per batch. Use more olive oil for the second batch if needed.
5. **Cook the Spaghetti:** Boil salted water and cook the spaghetti. Drain when finished.
6. **Finish the Sauce:** Add basil to the tomato sauce.
7. **Assemble and Serve:** Toss some tomato sauce with the spaghetti and divide onto plates. Top with grated cheese. Add chicken and dollops of sauce. Serve with the suggestion to dip chicken bites into the sauce.

## Cooking Philosophy
The author emphasizes a relaxed approach to cooking, preferring to eyeball and improvise rather than strictly measure ingredients or follow recipes precisely. The goal is to get a sense of how the food should look and feel during the cooking process.
