## Ingredients

- **Water**
- **Honey** (or other sugar)
- **Dry Yeast**
- **Salt**
- **Pecorino** (or other hard grating cheese)
- **Cornmeal**
- **Whole Wheat Flour**
- **Bread Flour**
- **Olive Oil**
- **Coarse Finishing Salt** (such as Maldon smoked sea salt)
- **Butter**
- **Garlic**
- **Fresh Herbs** (rosemary is classic, but sage was used in this recipe)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Dough:** Start with 2-3 cups (473-710mL) of water for a standard home sheet pan (adjust based on desired thickness). For each cup (237mL) of water, use a teaspoon each of salt, honey, and dry yeast, and about 30g of grated pecorino. Combine all these ingredients.
2. **Add Flours:** For every cup of water, add a big spoonful of cornmeal and two big spoonfuls of whole wheat flour. Add enough bread flour to bring it into a dough consistency.
3. **Let Dough Rise:** Cover and let rise for a couple of hours at room temperature or in the fridge for a day or two. A longer rise in the fridge enhances the flavor. Don't worry if the dough doesn't rise much.
4. **Stretch and Fold Dough:** Wet your hand, stretch one side of the dough out, and fold it back over. Repeat a few times until the dough won't stretch easily anymore.
5. **Prepare Baking Pan:** If your pan is not nonstick, line it with parchment paper. Oil the inside of your sheet pan liberally, place the dough in, and coat both the pan and the dough with oil. Stretch the dough as flat as possible, cover, and let it rise at room temperature until puffy.
6. **Prep for Baking:** Add a bit more oil on top. Use fingertips to dock the dough and stretch it into the corners of the pan. Top with crunchy finishing salt.
7. **Bake:** Bake at 400ºF/200ºC until very brown on top and the bread feels stiff when poked, about 15 minutes.
8. **Prepare Garlic-Herb Butter:** While baking, peel and chop garlic and herbs. Melt butter in the microwave with garlic to cook it, then stir in the herbs.
9. **Finish and Serve:** Once baked, slide the bread to a cooling rack. Brush with the butter/garlic/herb mixture and serve.
