## Ingredients

### Dough
- **All-Purpose Flour** - 2 cups (250g)
- **Sugar** - 1 teaspoon
- **Salt** - 1/2 teaspoon
- **Dry Yeast** - 1 teaspoon
- **Double-Acting Baking Powder** - 1/2 teaspoon
- **Oil** - 2 tablespoons
- **Milk or Water** - 1/2 cup (100mL), plus more as needed
- **Yogurt** - 1 tablespoon (ideally with live cultures)

### Toppings
- **Garlic** - Grated or chopped
- **Fresh Cilantro** - Chopped
- **Melted Butter** - (use additional salt if unsalted)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Dough:** Combine all dough ingredients and knead, adding more milk/water as needed, until you have a soft, springy, and slightly sticky dough. Cover the dough with a wet towel and let it rise until doubled in size, 1-2 hours or longer.
2. **Ready the Dough for Baking:** Knead the dough before baking, divide it into two balls, and let them rest for about 15 minutes.
3. **Preheat the Oven:** Position one oven rack near the top and another underneath with a tray or foil on the bottom rack to catch drips. Preheat the broiler/grill to its maximum setting.
4. **Roll and Add Toppings:** Roll the dough thinly, smear garlic and cilantro on top, then roll again to secure the toppings.
5. **Bake the Naan:** Place naan topping-side-down on the top oven rack. Bake for a couple of minutes until brown, then flip to bake the topping side until you see dark brown bubbles.
6. **Apply Butter:** Remove from the oven and brush with melted butter, adding salt if the butter is unsalted.
7. **Handle Stickiness:** If sticking occurs in subsequent batches, clean the grates with a brush, and optionally, lightly oil them.
8. **Serving Suggestion:** Bake one large loaf instead of several small ones for ease of handling.

Enjoy your homemade Naan!
